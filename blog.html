                    time travel is more intricate than preventing births? Consider the "Information Paradox": sending a
                    book back in time to Shakespeare could result in him penning the same works, but was he truly the
                    original author? Or ponder the "Butterfly Effect": stepping on a butterfly could trigger a chain of
                    events leading to massive changes in the timeline. These perplexing scenarios challenge our notions
                    of causality and have us questioning the threads that weave our reality.<br><br>
